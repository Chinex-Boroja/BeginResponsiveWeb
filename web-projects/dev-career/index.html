            In HTML, "form" elements are used to collect user input. The action
            attribute specifies the URL where the form data will be sent when
            the form is submitted.When you see action="#" in a form element, it
            means that the form is set to submit the data to the same URL it's
            currently on. In other words, when the form is submitted, it will
            send the data back to the current page.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sub-section">
          <h2>Action #</h2>
          <p>
            However, using action="#" is typically considered a placeholder or a
            workaround. It's often used when you're using JavaScript to handle
            form submissions and you want to prevent the page from refreshing.
            For example, you might have JavaScript code that intercepts the form
            submission event, processes the data using AJAX, and updates the
            page dynamically without a full page refresh.
